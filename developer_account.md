iOS         --> apple store
Android     --> google store

to create app ids
every app has an identifier that is called a reverse domain identifier

every app needs and identifier, every identifier is associated witha domain name of a website
like
your website is yourname.com and your app is fuba so the identifier of fuba would be         .yourname.fubar

you actually dont need to have a website to create an app and its idetifier, because your identifier is sothing you create. it's a good practice to have an developers account and register the app oficially and it enables you to test and deploy the app in a telephone

types of dev account
-individual
-company
